<br/>

The goal of this project is to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on AWS through Amazon EKS. 
To perform the deployment we will use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) together with 
its [aws-eks](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws/latest)
module. We will also be deploying two applications that are extremely 
used in the data engineering world, the orchestrator 
[Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) and also a dataviz tool,
the [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/).  


## **File Descriptions**
### **Folders**

- infrastructure : Corresponds to the terraform files to provisioning
EKS.

- k8s :
    - Airflow : .yaml files to deploy  
    - Superset : .yaml files to deploy

# **Required Instalations**
## **install kubectl** 

The instalation of the CLI kubectl was performed follow the oficial
documentation of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/#install-kubectl-binary-with-curl-on-linux)  
```
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
```

```
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

```
kubectl version --client
```
## **install Terraform for debian based Linux distro** 
The installation of terraform can be done by following the 
[official documentation] 
(https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli). For debian based linux distro the lines below are 
sufficient. 
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common curl
```
```
curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```
